## Power board

A circuit diagram and a PCB design for a modular power supply. It's based on a DC-DC step-down voltage buck converter module and can supply a Raspberry Pi or a similar single-board computer with 5V and up to 3A current. 

You can connect several power boards in a chain using [AVX bipolar card edge connector Series 9159](https://no.mouser.com/ProductDetail/581-00915900201106) and provide power to a cluster of Raspberry Pis.
